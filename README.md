# Max_Store_Sales_excel

Hello, Everyone I am sharing my data analysis project with the help of MS Excel. I have picked the dataset from the YouTube Channel. Objective: Max Store wants to create an an sales Dashboard for 2014 to 2017 so that the store can understand its marketing strategy and grow more sales in 2018. 

Questions asked:
What is the sales by category?
What are the profits over the different years? 
Who are the top 5 Customers that contributed to Profit? 
What are the monthly sales? 
What are the sales in different states?
What is the customer count in different years? 
Analysis: First of all, I understood the data in the data sets and find the business problems. I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values and made an Age group column from the Age column using the IF function. Created a Pivot table to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve business problems. At Last, I have built a dashboard in Excel with slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways to get results. 
Key insights:
Phones and Chairs are the most selling product
Profit in the technology business is gretaer than other two.
Maximum Sales is coming from the Texas
Customers are comparitively increasing over the years.
Tamara chand and Raymond buch are two top customers.
Sales are maximum in the month of novemeber.
